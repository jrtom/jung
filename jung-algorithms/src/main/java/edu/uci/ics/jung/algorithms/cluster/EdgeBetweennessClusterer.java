/**
 * An algorithm for computing clusters (community structure) in graphs based on edge betweenness.
 * The betweenness of an edge is defined as the extent to which that edge lies along shortest paths
 * between all pairs of nodes.
 *
 * <p>This algorithm works by iteratively following the 2 step process:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Compute edge betweenness for all edges in current graph
 *   <li>Remove edge with highest betweenness
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Running time is: O(kmn) where k is the number of edges to remove, m is the total number of
 * edges, and n is the total number of nodes. For very sparse graphs the running time is closer to
 * O(kn^2) and for graphs with strong community structure, the complexity is even lower.
 *
 * <p>This algorithm is a slight modification of the algorithm discussed below in that the number of
 * edges to be removed is parameterized.
