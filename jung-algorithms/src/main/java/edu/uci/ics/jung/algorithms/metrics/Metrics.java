   * <ul>
   *   <li><code>degree(v) == {0,1}</code>: 0
   *   <li><code>degree(v) == n, n &gt;= 2</code>: given S, the set of neighbors of <code>v</code>:

   *       of w) / ((|S| * (|S| - 1) / 2). Less formally, the fraction of <code>v</code>'s neighbors
   *       that are also neighbors of each other.
